The core objective of Knowledge Discovery in Data/Data Mining/Machine Learning methods is to provide efficient algorithms for gaining insight from data. CSC 466 primarily studies the methods and the algorithms that enable
such insight, and that specifically take this insight above and beyond traditional statistical analysis of data (more
about this â€” later in the course).
However, the true power of KDD/DM/ML methods that we will study in this course is witnessed only when
these methods are applied to actually gain insight from the data. As such, in this course, the deliverables for your
laboratory assignments will be partitioned into two categories:

1. KDD Method implementation. In most labs you will be asked to implement from scratch one or more
KDD method for producing a special type of insight from data. This part of the labs is similar to your other
CS coursework - you will submit your code, and, sometimes, your tests and/or output.

2. Insight, a.k.a., data analysis. For each lab assignment we will provide one or more datasets for your
perusal, and will ask you to perform the analysis of these datasets using the methods you implemented. The
results of this analysis, i.e., the insight, are as important for successful completion of your assignments, as
your implementations. Most of the time, you will be asked to submit a lab report detailing your analysis,
and containing the answers to the questions you are asked to study.
The insight portion of your deliverables is something that you may be seeing for the first time in your CS
coursework. It is not an afterthought in your lab assignments. Your grade will, in no small part, depend on
the results of your analysis, and the writing quality on your report. This lab assignment, and further assignments
will include detailed insturctions on how to prepare reports, and we will discuss report writing several times as
the course progresses.
